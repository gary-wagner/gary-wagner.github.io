title: "About me"
description: |
  I currently hold the Acadiana Business Economist Endowed Chair position at the University of Louisiana. In this role, I monitor   the region's economic environment, conduct research and analysis, and develop and maintain external stakeholder relationships on behalf of the Moody College of Business and University. 
  
  My research interests range from regional economics to state and local public finance issues, with a particular focus on fiscal institutions and place-based economic development. As of January 2020, I am also a co-editor for [*Contemporary Economic Policy*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657287).
  
  Prior to joining the University of Louisiana in 2018, I was (most recently) Vice-President & Senior Regional Officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
